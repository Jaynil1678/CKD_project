                <h4>Welcome to the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Predictor.
                    Our mission is to provide you with a simple, accessible, and data-driven tool to help you better understand your kidney health.</h4>

                <h1>The Technology Behind Our Prediction</h1>
                <h4>The predictions on this website are powered by a Logistic Regression machine learning model.
                    This model has been rigorously trained on a comprehensive dataset of anonymized patient health records to identify subtle patterns and relationships between various health indicators and the presence of CKD. While the model is designed for accuracy, its output is a probabilistic assessment, not a definitive diagnosis. We continuously strive to improve the model's performance and reliability.
